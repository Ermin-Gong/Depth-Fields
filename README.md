# Depth-Fields

README:

This is sample data and code for the 3DV 2015 paper "Depth Fields: Extending Light Field Techniques to Time-of-Flight Imaging". See website: http://molnargroup.ece.cornell.edu/people/suren-jayasuriya/depth-fields/. 

You will need to run MATLAB in order to run these scripts. However, it shouldn't be too hard to translate it to another language like Python, the code is pretty transparent.

Run "example_MonkeyPlant.m" or "example_phaseunwrapping.m" to recreate two of the figures in the paper: partial occlusion and phase unwrapping. 

Any comments/suggestions/improvements to the code/ideas in this paper, feel free to send to me at sj498@cornell.edu. I want to acknowledge all my collaborators who helped write code including Adithya Pediredla, Ryuichi Tadano, Sriram Sivaramakrishnan, and previous code written by Dr. Gordon Wetzstein. However, I bear sole responsibility for any mistakes and bad code. 

Best,
Suren Jayasuriya
